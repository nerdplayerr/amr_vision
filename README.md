AMR VISION BASED ON YOLOV8
------------------------------------------------------------------  
Note: This repository only contains packages for object detection and tracking with YOLOv8 exported to TensorRT

  This Autonomous Mobile Robot is designed to move a shelf from one point to another automatically. There are times when unwanted things might happen such as boxes or people blocking the robot's moving path. Therefore, this system is designed to overcome this problem.
